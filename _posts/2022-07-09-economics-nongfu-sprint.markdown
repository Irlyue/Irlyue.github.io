# Nongfu spring
***
"We are not manufactures of water. We are **porters** of nature." So goes a famous quip by Zhong Shanshan, the 66-year-old founder and boss of Nongfu Spring, China's most popular brand of bottled water. On September 8th the Hangzhou-based bottler listed on Hong Kong's **bourse** to spectacular fanfare. Demand for shares from **retail investors outstripped** supply by 1,148 times. The share price **shot up** by 60% over the first three days of trading. Its **market capitalisation** reached $53bn. Mr Zhong, who still owns 84% of Nongfu Spring, is now China's third-richest person, narrowly trailing two tech **moguls**: Jack Ma of Alibaba and (unreleated) Pony Ma of Tencent.

Rising **disposable incomes** and public anxiety about the safety of **tap water**, which is unfit to drink in most of China, have **fuelled** demand among Chinese for the bottled variety. Consumption per person of bottled water rose from 41 litres in 2014 to 59 litres in 2019, accoding to data from Mintel, a market-research firm. Americans, by comparison, **guzzled** an avergage of 141 litres last year. That suggests Chinese bottlers still have plenty of room for growth, **not least** because tap water in Americal is (typically) **potable**.

- tap water: 自来水
- fuel: 加速了，促进了（这里可以翻译为推动了国内对瓶装水的需求）

Nongfu Spring is the **runaway** industry leader. It accounted for 29% of the volume sold in China in 2019. Foreign brands such as FIJI Water, Evian (owned by Danone) and Aquafina (part of PepsiCo) are easily spotted in many Chinese supermarkets. But non has a market share greater than 6.5%, reckons Mintel.
- runaway，迅速的
  - runaway success，大获成功
  - runaway: 比如用来描述runaway animal表示失控的，这里感觉可以理解为遥遥领先的。

One reason for Nongfu's success is its effort to **cater to** all market segments. Stingy folk can buy a **mass-market** 380ml-plastic bottle for as little as 1.5 yuan ($0.22). The **well-heeled** may **opt for** the glass-bottled version, which comes with "award-winning" designs and **retails** for 30-45 yuan. In betwen you can get a lithium-rich liquid which is claimed to benefit the nervous system. Total revenues across Nongfu's waters increased by 42% between 2017 and 2019, to 14.3bn yuan. **Gross margins** held steady at an impressive 60%.
- cater to: 满足...的需求，或者说迎合...的需求，这里就是说满足所有精分市场的需求.

- opt for，选择
- 描写不同人群的用词
  - stingy folk，指小气的，吝啬的，这里作者没有用类似贫穷的词语，感觉可以翻译为没那么大方的
  - the well-heeled，heel有脚后跟的意思，作动词也表示给鞋子的后跟修理，那你想想一般只有那些上流社会的人才会有这种待遇，那well-heeled从字面上理解就是那些鞋子后跟清理的很干净的人，引申为有钱人、富人。
- revenue，营业额
- gross margin，毛利率

Nongfu **sceptics** point out that the bottled-water industry, in China and elsewhere, has few techincal **barriers to entry**. The main raw material is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic that is cheap and easy to process. No special knowledge is required. Evergrande, a Chinese property developer, boasts its own line of bottled water called Evergrande Spring. The water itself tends to be an afterthought.
- sceptics，怀疑论者，对什么持怀疑态度的人
- barrier to entry，门槛
- boast，拥有，指很自豪地拥有
- line，产品线

Not in Nongfu's case. As its aggressive marketers never tire of stressing, it possesses **water-extraction permits** for ten of China's most famous unspoilt bodies of water-from Thousand Island Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang to Mount Tianshan in the remote western region of Xinjiang. The permits, granted by local governments for up to 30 years, are a **moat** against competitors. Loris Li, an independent analyst of China's **beverage** industry, observes that "the quality of the orignal water source" can be a strong point of **brand differentiaion**.

Nongfu Spring has another edge: it is seen as close to Chinese **officialdom**. At high-level political **summits**, rows of Nongfu bottles arranged on tables are common sight. As sources of advantage go, it doesn't get better than this in China.
- officialdom，官场（什么什么dom，就是什么的地盘，比如kingdom，王的地盘，这里官员的地盘其实就是官场）
- summit，峰会，其实就简单理解为重要会议
- as..go，与一般的...相比
  - As racing cars go, this one is extraordinary.
